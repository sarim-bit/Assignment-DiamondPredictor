## App Development
- This app was developed in RStudio using Shiny.
- The *diamonds* dataset was used.
- *ggplot2* and *dplyr* libraries were used.

## App Info
- Diamond Price depends on different parameters.
- The parameters used for price prediction are **carats**, **cut**, **color**, and **clarity**
- This app asks the user to input all the information they have and then predicts the price.
- The more information given the better is the prediction.

## The diamond dataset

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
head(diamonds)
```
